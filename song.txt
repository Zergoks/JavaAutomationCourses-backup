Through the gates of hell
As we make our way to heaven
Through the Nazi lines

We've been training for years
Now we're ready to strike
As the great operation begins
We're the first wave on the shore

We're the first ones to fall
Yet soldiers have fallen before

With their lives as the price

History's written today

Know that nothing remains
As our forces advance on the beach

Aiming for heaven though serving in hell
Victory is ours their forces will fall

Through the gates of hell
As we make our way to heaven
Through the Nazi lines
Primo victoria
